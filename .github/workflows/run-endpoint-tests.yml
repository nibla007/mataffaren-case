# Trigger which git action (push, pull_request)
# in which branch(es) should start the jobs...
on:
  push:
    branches: [dev]
  # add branch-protection-rules in github for main (require pull-request)
  # then add another branch and try to make a pull-request in github
  # to merge your branch into main:
  # - the following will happens: these tests will run
  # - and a report of success/failure will be shown to the person
  #   approving the pull request

# jobs to run
jobs:
  # build, the name of the job, a server to create and auto configure
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      # only testing on Node 18 now but could have done
      # several builds by adding [16.x, 18.x] etc

      - run: npm ci
        # start up the backend server
        # (that needs to run if we should be
